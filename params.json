{"name":"FliSharp","tagline":".Net wrapper for FLI SDK","body":"FLISharp is an unofficial C# wrapper library for Finger Lake Instrument's (FLI) software development kit (SDK).  They've built a great SDK and C# has great facilities for wrapping C code and DLLs, and here we combine them both for your convenience and astronomical pleasure!\r\n\r\n#Contents\r\nThere are two primary pieces of useful content in this repository.\r\n\r\n###FliSharp.cs\r\nThis file contains all the wrapping code to interface with LibFli.dll.  It's broken into five parts: constants, enums, members, static APIs, and device APIs.  Device APIs are those that require a device handle (which this class wraps into an object instance), compared with static APIs that don't.  With this file and [FLI_SDK_Documentation.pdf](http://www.flicamera.com/downloads/FLI_SDK_Documentation.pdf), one should easily be able to understand what's happening on both the software and camera level.\r\n\r\n###Program.cs\r\nThis is largely example code in the form of a test program.  \r\n\r\n###Project files\r\nYou'll also find project and other ancillary files to get you started building using Visual Studio instantly!\r\n\r\n#Status\r\nThe full FLI SDK has not been exhaustively exposed, but most things that most people would want to do should be there.  If not, it should be easy enough to follow the pattern and create whatever is needed.  Testing thus far has only been against a PL09000.  Any other cameras made available to the project owner will happily be tested for compatibility.\r\n\r\n#Thanks\r\nThis software was made possible by the [SETI Institute](http://www.seti.org).  Their mission is to explore, understand, and explain the origin and nature of life in the universe, and to apply the knowledge gained to inspire and guide present and future generations.
